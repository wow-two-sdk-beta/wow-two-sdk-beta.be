# wow-two-sdk-beta.be

## What is this

The `WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.*` family — beta-forever .NET 10 be sdk aggregating wrappers around the entire .NET ecosystem (~10K+ packages reachable via composition). Same beta-forever philosophy as the UI lib: no CHANGELOG or PR gate; required checks run in the release workflow, and main pushes publish the family.

> **Beta-forever rules**: no CHANGELOG or PR gate; push directly to main and fix forward. CI tests, auto-bumps `10.y.z-beta`, verifies eight packages, publishes and records the release commit/tag.

> **Structure (current): eight release projects.** `src/WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.csproj` compiles all production concerns. Separate projects ship the BCL-only kernel `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be.Abstractions` (`src/Abstractions/`: Result, AppError, IEvent, ICurrentUserService; core references it and forwards the moved types), data abstractions, the migration CLI and four testing libraries. Seven test suites are non-packable. Per-area folders are PascalCase and match namespace segments. Rationale + migration log + backlog: [`engineering/architecture/analysis/mono-lib-migration.md`](./engineering/architecture/analysis/mono-lib-migration.md).

## Source-of-truth docs

- **[`engineering/architecture/analysis/philosophy/ideas.md`](./engineering/architecture/analysis/philosophy/ideas.md)** — encyclopedic catalog of every .NET tech / pattern / library / runtime API. **No verdicts** — pure inventory. Source of ideas; read when considering scope expansion.
- **[`engineering/architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md`](./engineering/architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md)** — verdict per item: **DONE / NOW / NEXT / LATER / MAYBE / SKIP / LOCKED**. Mirrors `ideas.md`'s structure. Read when deciding what to ship next.
- **[`engineering/architecture/package-layout.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-layout.md)** — SDK-internal architecture: repo + per-package shape, layering, package-id grammar, three-layer doc strategy. Code-style conventions (naming, documentation) are centralized in `wow-two-ws/conventions/`.
- **[`engineering/architecture/package-registry.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-registry.md)** — per-area shipped-status lookup table.
- **[`engineering/architecture/templates/`](./engineering/architecture/templates/)** — copy-paste templates for new packages (`csproj`, `Module.cs`, `Options.cs`, `standard.md`, `spec.md`, `Tests.cs`, `folder-doc.md` — the folder lead doc, copied to `{folder}.md`).
- **[`engineering/planning/backlog.md`](./engineering/planning/backlog.md)** — every unbuilt item: the SDK's vectors, fixes and ecosystem adoption. Format follows `conventions/planning/version-track/`.
- **[`engineering/research/research.md`](./engineering/research/research.md)** — analyses and per-vector deep-dives (e.g. [`identity/identity-architecture.md`](./engineering/research/identity/identity-architecture.md)).

When scope expansion is considered, walk `targets.md` first. If the desired vector is missing or marked **MAYBE/LATER**, raise it for triage and update both files. Treat these two as a paired source-of-truth — when one changes, sync the other.

## Phase model (P0–P6)

See [`targets.md` §6](./engineering/architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md#6-phase-mapping). Quick reference:

| Phase | Bundle | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | testing helpers and seven regression suites | implemented; four published testing companions |
| P1 | boot floor — foundation + observability + web basics | shipped within the mono library |
| P2 | request pipeline + auth | ✅ shipped (mediator + identity, incl. otp/otp.telegram/jwt.issuance + 16 OAuth providers) |
| P3 | persistence + outbound | data/HTTP/cache adapters ship; opt-in sessions and outbound safety since `10.0.59-beta` |
| P4 | distributed essentials | comms/email, Hangfire, messaging and webhooks ship; periodic scoped jobs implemented |
| meta | `AddApiDefaults()` / `UseApiDefaults()` one-import boot floor (`src/Meta/`) | ✅ shipped |
| P5 | SaaS-shaped (tenancy + AI + flags) | planned |
| P6 | heavy domain extensions | planned |

## Repo layout

Shell shape per [`sdk-structure.md`](../../../conventions/development/repo/structure/sdk-structure.md) — `engineering/` bears the docs, `engineering/codebase/{slug}/` bears the one code dir.

> **Path convention**: a bare `src/…` in any doc is **code-dir-relative** (`engineering/codebase/wow-two-sdk-beta-be/src/…`), matching the frontend SDK.

## Per-package shape

Capability folders compile into the mono library. Only the eight declared release projects own csproj files; a capability folder follows:

```
src/<area>/<package>/
├── <Module>ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs   ← descriptive `Add<Concrete>` extension(s)
├── <Public types>.cs
├── <Module>.standard.md                     ← RFC 2119 contract (when API has shape)
├── <Module>.spec.md                         ← API + usage snippets (when API has shape)
└── <folder>.md                              ← folder lead doc (kebab folder name, e.g. `time.md`) — 1-screen quickstart + see-also. NOT `README.md` below the repo root
```

**Naming**: package IDs use `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be[.*]`; namespaces use `WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.*`, but **method/class names do NOT have a `WowTwo` prefix** — they describe what they actually do (e.g. `AddJwtBearerAuthentication`, `AddOpenTelemetryTracing`, `UseOwaspSecureHeaders`, `JsonOptionsPresets`, `WebApiTestBase<T>`). Mirrors the older `Backbone.Language.Features.Serialization` package convention. Symbol-level naming is centralized in `wow-two-ws/conventions/development/backend/dotnet/core/lla/notation/naming/naming.md` (§Registration and extension-method naming); package-id grammar lives in [`engineering/architecture/package-layout.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-layout.md).

Tiny adapter folders (e.g. each container engine) contain the implementation and folder lead doc `{folder}.md`. Standard/spec are reserved for packages where the API has non-trivial shape.

See [`engineering/architecture/package-layout.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-layout.md).

## Dependency model

- `Directory.Packages.props` is the single source of truth for NuGet versions (Central Package Management).
- Every csproj inherits `Directory.Build.props` — `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`, `Nullable enable`, `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>`, `MIT`, source-link, deterministic builds.
- Foundation can NOT import domain packages. Domain packages can import any sibling domain. (Future: enforce via Roslyn analyzer.)
- The kernel (`src/Abstractions/`) references nothing — no `FrameworkReference`, no `PackageReference`. Core references the kernel and never a domain repo's package. A type moved into the kernel keeps its namespace and gets a `[TypeForwardedTo]` line in `src/Properties/KernelTypeForwarders.cs`.
- Solution file is `engineering/codebase/wow-two-sdk-beta-be/src/WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.slnx` (.NET 10 SDK XML solution format).

## Build & test

```bash
cd engineering/codebase/wow-two-sdk-beta-be/src
dotnet restore -m:1                                  # -m:1 avoids EMFILE on macOS
dotnet build WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.slnx --no-restore -m:1
```

Use `-m:1` for `dotnet pack` as well, including `--no-build --no-restore` invocations: packing still evaluates project references.
Verify the package family with `scripts/verify-release-packages.sh`; an exit code alone does not establish package output.

Set `MSBUILDDISABLENODEREUSE=1` and `ulimit -n 65535` if you hit "too many open files."

## Package naming

Published IDs use the owned `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be[.*]` prefix; namespaces use
`WoW.Two.Sdk.Beta.Be.*`. Package-id grammar lives in
[`engineering/architecture/package-layout.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-layout.md).

Registration: descriptive method names without `WowTwo` prefix — `services.AddJwtBearerAuthentication(...)`, `services.AddPerIpSlidingWindowRateLimit()`, `services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing(...)`. The package name carries the brand; the method name carries the meaning. Full rule: `wow-two-ws/conventions/development/backend/dotnet/core/lla/notation/naming/naming.md` (§Registration and extension-method naming).

## Documentation strategy

**Wrappers** ship docs (`spec.md`, `standard.md`, the folder lead doc `{folder}.md`, `Tests.cs` examples). **Underlying libs** are NOT documented by us — we link to their official docs.

Three-layer strategy + cadence: [`engineering/architecture/package-layout.md`](./engineering/architecture/package-layout.md) §Doc strategy. Wrapper-doc format (`*.standard.md` / `*.spec.md` / xUnit-as-docs): `wow-two-ws/conventions/development/backend/dotnet/core/lla/notation/documentation/documentation.md` §Wrapper / package docs.

## Working rules

- **Spec before code** for any wrapper with non-trivial API shape.
- **Foundation cannot import domain packages.** Future Roslyn analyzer.
- **Source-gen first** — Mapperly, Vogen, source-gen JSON, source-gen logging, source-gen options validation.
- **Every public type has XML doc.** Enforced via `GenerateDocumentationFile` + analyzer.
- **No commercial-license dependencies in the core meta-package.** MediatR/AutoMapper/MassTransit/Duende/iText are all SKIP'd from core; opt-in adapters in companion packages only.
- **Permissive licenses only in core**: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3, BSD-2, MS-PL, Unlicense.

## Out of scope

- No compatibility guarantee between beta releases
- No CHANGELOG (git log is the changelog)
- No PR review (push to main)
- No graduation/distill rule yet — beta-forever until platform layer matures.
