# Backend convention sweep

*Last updated: 2026-10-16*

## Status

The [September 26 implementation sweep](engineering/research/sdk-completion/sweep-2026-09-26.md)
is the current SDK completion handoff: opt-in data sessions, Dapper read safety, outbound HTTP
protection and atomic idempotency are implemented locally. Release tests passed 609 with one
existing Kafka skip; seven local package/symbol pairs verified. Publication remains pending.

✅ **SDK commit batches and the follow-up convention sweep are complete.** `10.0.57-beta` contains the CI correction.
The autonomous SDK adoption cut (`ba2a87e`) is published as `10.0.58-beta`; its verification is in the adoption track.
The [ForeverPin adoption sweep](engineering/research/foreverpin-adoption/foreverpin-adoption.md) owns the newly
identified behavioral fixes and the combined upgrade cut; earlier convention completion does not close those findings.
Fresh verification and the signed commit inventory are in the
[batch verification report](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/commit-batches-verification.md).
This is the active handoff. Completed/refuted rows, old measurements and superseded discussion
are retained in [the historical snapshot](be-convention-sweep-history.md).
Historical completion markers are not a fresh source or runtime certification.
[Live SDK recheck](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/sdk-handoff-recheck.md) confirms the
completed session naming/placement slices. The CloudEvents decoder's reopened N91 failure-contract
work is also complete; its fresh verification is linked below.

## Execution

- Finish SDK implementation and scoped checks; CI/release work follows the implementation sweep.
- Rule owners live under `wow-two-ws/conventions/development/backend/dotnet/`; paths below are relative to it.
- Recheck each row against current source and its owner. Historical counts are inventory leads.
- Preserve row IDs. Highest naming ID is N114; only a distinct obligation earns N115.
  Historical N94–N98 duplicates require subject-qualified references; new work extends an existing row.
- Product adoption is separate: the 31 product rows live in
  `workbench/ventures/10x-venture-forever-pin/foreverpin-be-update.md`.
- Use `engineering/scripts/sweep.sh` for convention checks; source checks do not replace runtime checks.
- Ordinary agent commits require the repository's persistent native commit switch; the developer publishes.
  Breaking SDK changes are approved; no production consumers exist.

### Workstream order

1. Completed: drain the SDK's pending changes in cohesive, reviewed commit batches.
2. Completed: sweep the SDK against the conventions again and resolve mechanical findings.
3. Completed: CI publication-verifier correction committed as `a645d1b`, released in `10.0.57-beta`.
4. Completed: full ForeverPin SDK-facing sweep; autonomous SDK gaps corrected, deferred policy decisions preserved.
5. Completed publication as `10.0.58-beta`. Upgrade ForeverPin once, including its product adoption changes.
6. September 26: autonomous SDK completion is authorized independently of consumer adoption; current work and remaining vectors live in the implementation sweep.

Other consumer repins remain recorded below; they do not precede the requested ForeverPin migration.

The sweep includes data-safety slices such as tracked writes and migration guarantees. The full data-session build is
larger than this sweep and remains owned by `engineering/research/data-pipeline/`. Localization request culture and
formatters exist; complete translation/i18n remains a later vector in `targets.md` and the errors architecture.

## Remaining SDK work

### Release-dependent consumer adoption

- [ ] When TranscriptForge is repinned from `WoW2.Sdk.Backend.Beta` `10.0.44-beta` to `WoW2.Sdk.Beta.Be`
  at the published sweep version, add the new caption parser namespace in its fetcher and VTT tests, and run its
  consumer checks.
  Exact files/imports: [parser verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/parser-conformance-verification.md#reference-inventory-and-adoption).
  This adoption task is separate from the 27 SDK implementation rows; it depends on the published version.
- [ ] Repin the other direct consumers to the published sweep version and repair only the APIs each uses:
  ForeverPin (`10.0.45-beta`), TransportBrain (`10.0.45-beta`), Tnis (`10.0.45-beta`), Wheelhouse (`10.0.40-beta`),
  SecretsVault (`10.0.56-beta`), ListingShelf (`10.0.56-beta`), Sift (`10.0.21-beta`), Arcade (`10.0.21-beta`),
  MuseumsGallery (`10.0.21-beta`) and TnisMintrans (`10.0.21-beta`). Pins rechecked 2026-09-24; SecretsVault
  already consumes `IValueCipher`. Repin the product template (`10.0.21-beta`) separately so new ventures start current.

## Scope retained from confirmed decisions

- C25 retains the phase/job ordering check from N98 (interceptor vocabulary), including
  `ClaimCheckRehydratingConsumeInterceptor`; a completed rename does not establish pipeline behavior.
- N100/N101 vocabulary is settled: Parser, Exporter, Formatter, Transport, Serializer and Bus are approved.
  Integrity checks use Validator; Google token evidence uses Authenticator. Internal wrappers use Model;
  actual event payloads retain Event. No naming decision remains pending.

## Verification evidence

- [2026-09-19 batch verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/commit-batches-verification.md):
  Release checks pass 455 tests with one intentional Kafka skip. The follow-up fixes cover inbox lock lifecycle,
  annotated release tags, four remaining helper roles and the startup child probe's build configuration.
- [Naming inventory and report index](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/sdk-naming-inventory.md).
- [SDK handoff recheck](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/sdk-handoff-recheck.md).
- [Retained-role verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/retained-role-conformance-verification.md):
  Exporter/Serializer/Bus placement, scoped compilation and 26 existing serializer/pump tests.
  These do not establish exporter runtime contracts, GeoJSON fidelity,
  provider delivery guarantees or whole-SDK release readiness.
- [CloudEvents decoder verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/cloudevents-decoder-verification.md):
  complete-document parsing and failure results for malformed JSON/base64; all 37 serializer tests passed.
  Inbound context attributes remain outside this payload decoder's semantic validation contract.
- [N101 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/n101-conformance-verification.md):
  Transport placement, saga classification, GeoJSON contracts and Google cancellation are complete.
- [N111 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/n111-options-registration-verification.md):
  SDK-owned code options use direct values or startup-validated pipelines; only topology composers retain raw
  `AddOptions<T>`, and resolving delayed-retry options no longer mutates the service collection.
- [N115 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/n115-dependency-remediation-verification.md):
  all 14 projects are vulnerability-clear against live NuGet data; the solution builds and 399 tests pass.
- [C15 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c15-api-defaults-pipeline-verification.md):
  the host-controlled identity seam runs after routing and before limiter/cache policies; all 47 Web tests pass.
- [C16 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c16-build-packaging-verification.md):
  test projects evaluate non-packable, seven release projects remain packable and local/CI use the same SDK pin.
- [C17 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c17-release-pipeline-verification.md):
  CI tests one release commit, verifies all seven package pairs and records the exact revision/version manifest.
- [C18 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c18-test-host-isolation-verification.md):
  both clock APIs share one test clock; host configuration and database-provider selection are instance-local.
- [C19 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c19-migration-guarantees-verification.md):
  provider coordination, recovery, enum boundaries, SQLite rebuilds and CLI exits pass 26 migration tests.
- [C20 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c20-jwt-trust-verification.md):
  one key source, secure metadata and algorithm-specific key requirements pass all 20 Identity tests.
- [C22 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c22-observability-contract-verification.md):
  SDK telemetry collection, correlation, bounded tags and exporter isolation pass 69 Mediator and 121 Messaging tests.
- [C23 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c23-startup-failure-reporting-verification.md):
  pre-host and options-validation child failures persist durably and exit nonzero; all 52 Web tests pass.
- [C24 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c24-http-replay-safety-verification.md):
  unsafe methods run once by default, explicit idempotency selectors permit replay, and nine focused tests cover
  cancellation, total budgets, streaming rejection and disposal.
- [C25 verification](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/c25-tenant-messaging-guarantees-verification.md):
  EF and generated Dapper CRUD enforce ambient tenant scope; messaging documents and tests at-least-once delivery,
  atomic durable dedupe/effect, bounded queues/retries, failed-outbox retention and forced-final claim-check rehydration.
- [Release readiness](../../../system/sessions/backend-beta-build/release-readiness-verification.md):
  the Release solution builds, 453 tests pass with one intentional Kafka skip, and all seven package/symbol pairs
  pass the metadata, asset, dependency and revision verifier at `10.0.55-beta`.
