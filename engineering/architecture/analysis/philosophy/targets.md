## Current implementation checkpoint

The phase inventories below retain the original catalog priorities; they are not a release manifest.
Current source and test evidence: [September 26 sweep](../../../research/sdk-completion/sweep-2026-09-26.md).
The mono library plus six companion outputs target .NET 10. Outbound destination safety, scoped data
sessions, generated Dapper read policies and atomic mediator idempotency are implemented locally,
with publication pending. Background workers, transaction-aware cache invalidation, full-row write
guards and translation remain active completion work.

## 0. Verdict legend

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **LOCKED** | Architectural decision. Won't change without proposal. |
| **DONE** | Already shipped (or imported as-is). |
| **NOW** | Active sprint. Implement before next batch. |
| **NEXT** | Plan to start once NOW clears. |
| **LATER** | On the roadmap, not soon. Keep visible so it doesn't drift. |
| **MAYBE** | Unclear — needs triage / spike before commit. |
| **SKIP** | Decided not to implement. Reason given. |

---

## 1. Locked architectural decisions

| # | Decision | LOCKED rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Single big package** — `wow-two-sdk-beta.be` aggregates every concern; subpath imports per area | Dependency bloat is explicitly accepted. One install, batteries included. Mirrors UI lib's "one big package, subpath exports". |
| 1.2 | **.NET 10 baseline, multi-target later if needed** | Evaluated projects target `net10.0`; SDK `10.0.300` is pinned with patch roll-forward. |
| 1.3 | **Current C# language features freely** | `LangVersion=latest` under the pinned .NET SDK; runtime and language changes follow evaluated build settings. |
| 1.4 | **Built-in DI (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`) is the contract** | Don't ship Autofac/Lamar replacements. Consumers can swap if they want — we expose `IServiceCollection` extensions. |
| 1.5 | **Source-gen preferred over reflection** for mapping, JSON, validation, DI graph, regex | AOT-friendly, faster, fewer trim warnings. |
| 1.6 | **AOT-compatible best-effort** | Don't *require* AOT, but every component should compile under `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` without warnings if possible. |
| 1.7 | **Modular Monolith first** — microservices is a deployment choice, not a code shape | Make module boundaries cheap (DI conventions, in-process mediator, Outbox abstractions). Easy escalation path to distributed messaging later. |
| 1.8 | **Clean Architecture × Vertical Slice hybrid** | Layering for the foundation (`tokens`, `primitives`, `domains`); vertical slices inside each domain feature. Borrow the UI lib's `foundation/domain` mental model. |
| 1.9 | **Beta-forever versioning** | `10.y.z-beta`, CI auto-bumps on main publication. Fix-forward; no CHANGELOG or PR gate. Required Release tests and seven-package verification precede publication. |
| 1.10 | **System.Text.Json default; Newtonsoft only when an external lib forces it** | STJ is now feature-complete enough (polymorphism, source-gen, JsonNode mutability). Newtonsoft pulled in transitively only. |
| 1.11 | **`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>` is the only public log surface** | Internally we may use Serilog, but consumers see `ILogger<T>`. Same pattern for telemetry — `ActivitySource` and `Meter` are the public seams. |
| 1.12 | **No commercial license deps in the core meta-package** | MediatR (commercial 12.0+), AutoMapper (commercial 14.0+), MassTransit (commercial v9+ announced), Duende.IdentityServer (RPL), iText7 (AGPL), Aspose, Spire — all are SKIP for the core. May surface as opt-in adapters in companion packages but never as core dependencies. |
| 1.13 | **Permissive licenses only in core**: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3, BSD-2, MS-PL, Unlicense | LGPL only when it's truly transitive-and-isolated (e.g. linking decisions). AGPL never. |
| 1.14 | **No PR gate; required release checks** | The developer publishes main; CI runs tests and package verification before publishing all seven outputs. |
| 1.15 | **Standard + spec before code (per-component)** | Borrow the UI lib pattern — every public abstraction begins as `*.standard.md` (RFC 2119 contract) and `*.spec.md` (concrete API). |
| 1.16 | **Subpath exports per top-level src/ folder** | Consumers can pull `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.web` only, or pull the meta. Modeled on UI lib's `forms/`, `display/`, `nav/` subpaths. |
| 1.17 | **Messaging runs on the SDK's own transport port and EF outbox** — CAP, MassTransit and Wolverine plug in only as adapters under the port (resolves the former 9.2) | CAP is a framework peer, not a transport: CAP-first would reduce the ports to thin CAP wrappers and limit pluggability to CAP's providers. |

## 5. Configuration leak point inventory verdict — NEXT

Mirrors §7 of `ideas.md`. For each leak point, define a typed `record TFooOptions(...)` with source-gen `[OptionsValidator]` validation. Group: hosting, auth, DB, cache, messaging, storage, email, SMS/push, search, vector, LLM provider, telemetry, logging sinks, health checks, rate limiting, jobs, feature flags, multi-tenancy, localization, CORS, compression, anti-forgery, DataProtection, HSTS, static files, OpenAPI, gRPC, GraphQL, SignalR, resilience, webhook delivery.

Convention: each module exports `services.AddWowFoo(o => { ... })`. Each option type lives in `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.{module}/Options/`.

## 6. Phase mapping (revised P0–P6, dependency-aware + value-first)

Decoupled from UI lib's P1–P6. Reasoning:

- **Identity moved out of "data + messaging"** — most APIs need auth from day 1 without taking on EF Core.
- **Testing extracted to P0 (parallel track)** — every wrapper must ship with runnable examples; testing scaffold can't be a Phase-4 afterthought.
- **Mediator + ProblemDetails promoted** — these are seams everything else hangs on, not P2 add-ons.
- **Real-time / search / workflow / media demoted** — domain-specific; most apps need 0–2.

| Phase | Bundle | Scope (NOW + NEXT items) | Stop here if… |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 — testing scaffold (parallel track)** | `testing` companion package | `WebApiTestHost<T>` + Testcontainers fixtures (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, Mongo, Kafka, Azurite) + Verify + AwesomeAssertions + Bogus + WireMock.Net | n/a — never stops; grows with every wrapper |
| **P1 — boot floor** | foundation + `observability` + `web` (basics) | Hosting / DI conventions / Options + source-gen validation / Serilog→`ILogger<T>` seam / OTel SDK + auto-instrumentation / ProblemDetails (built-in + Hellang) / `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` / Health checks (Xabaril core providers) / Rate limiting / Output cache (HybridCache memory mode) / Secure-headers middleware / `TimeProvider` + Cronos / Analyzer pack + `.editorconfig` | "Hello World API with logs/traces/health/openapi/rate-limit/problemdetails" — broadest applicability, lowest risk |
| **P2 — request pipeline + auth** | `mediator` + `validation` + `errors` + `identity` | In-proc mediator (our facade, MediatR-API-compat) / FluentValidation pipeline behavior / `IExceptionHandler` global / **Identity API endpoints + JWT bearer + OIDC** / Vogen + Ardalis.GuardClauses / ErrorOr Result type / OneOf / Idempotency middleware | Stateless API (microservice doing HTTP + JWT + downstream calls) — no DB needed |
| **P3 — persistence + outbound** | `data` + `caching` + `http` | EF Core (SqlServer/Npgsql/Pomelo/Sqlite) + audit interceptor + soft-delete filter / Dapper / EFCore.BulkExtensions / EFCore.NamingConventions / EFCore.Projectables / HybridCache + Redis L2 / Refit + `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` / DbUp + EF Migrations runners | Single-instance API with persistence — no horizontal scale |
| **P4 — distributed essentials** | `messaging` + `jobs` + `comms` | DotNetCore.CAP outbox + inbox / Hangfire (Postgres/Redis storage) / Comms abstractions (`IEmailBroker` MailKit, `ISmsSender` Twilio, `IPushSender` FCM/dotAPNS) / Webhook delivery infra (HMAC + retry + DLQ) | Multi-instance reliable distributed services |
| **P5 — multi-tenant + AI + flags** | `tenancy` + `ai` + `feature-flags` | Finbuckle multi-tenancy (per-row only) / `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` + Semantic Kernel + provider adapters / vector store adapters (Pgvector, Redis, Qdrant, Pinecone, Milvus, Chroma) / `Microsoft.FeatureManagement` + OpenFeature seam | SaaS-shaped products with AI features |
| **P6 — heavy domain extensions** | `realtime` + `storage` + `search` + `workflow` + extras | SignalR + Redis backplane + SSE / FluentStorage + ImageSharp + QuestPDF + ClosedXML + CsvHelper + Markdig / Postgres tsvector + OpenSearch adapter / Stateless workflow / Aspire integrations / OpenIddict OIDC server adapter / GraphQL (HotChocolate) / OData / AsyncAPI / Kiota client gen / Native AOT certification / Payment adapters (Stripe.net) / Geo (NetTopologySuite + MaxMind) / Email templating (FluentEmail) / OCR (Tesseract) / Documents (DocFX site) | Domain-complete platform |

**Sequencing principle**: each phase is shippable on its own. Drop out at any phase if your app doesn't need the next layer. P0 grows continuously alongside P1–P6.

## 7. Companion package roadmap (out of core)

Things deliberately **not** in the meta-package. Either license-incompatible, scope-heavy, or niche.

| Companion | Reason |
|---|---|
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.testing` | Test-only; keep core lean |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.aspire-azure` | Azure-only adapters |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.aspire-aws` | AWS-only adapters |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.identity-duende` | Commercial license |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.identity-openiddict` | OSS alt to Duende |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.messaging-masstransit` | Commercial (v9+) |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.messaging-wolverine` | Modern OSS alt |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.graphql-hotchocolate` | Heavy surface |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.odata` | Niche |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.event-sourcing-marten` | Postgres-specific ES |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.event-sourcing-kurrent` | EventStoreDB |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.workflow-elsa` / `.workflow-temporal` | Heavy workflow engines |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.media-ffmpeg` | Native deps |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.media-ocr` | Tesseract / OCR |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.search-elastic` / `.search-opensearch` | Cluster-grade search |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.payments-stripe` | Commerce-domain |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.docs` | DocFX site generator |
| `wow-two-sdk-beta.be.cli` | Spectre.Console-based CLI scaffolding |

---

## 8. Out-of-scope — explicit list

Things we deliberately won't build, with rationale.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Browser / mobile clients | UI lib's job |
| F# idiomatic surface | C#-first; F# can consume |
| Game engine integration (Unity/Godot) | Out of scope for backend |
| Service Fabric integration | Legacy |
| WCF / SOAP servers | CoreWCF community handles it; SKIP |
| Blazor UI components | UI lib |
| Office Interop (Microsoft.Office.Interop.\*) | Win-only, awful API; use OpenXML instead |
| BinaryFormatter / NRBF write | Insecure; only NRBF read for legacy |
| MSMQ transport | Legacy |
| WebForms / ASP.NET 4.x | Legacy |
| Razor.Web Pages legacy | Use Razor Pages or Blazor |
| Custom DI container | MS DI is the contract |
| Custom JSON serializer | STJ is the contract |
| Custom logging facade | `ILogger<T>` is the contract |
| Twitter/X authentication | Sunset API v1.1; use the X v2 OIDC if needed |
| IdentityServer4 integration | EOL |
| Personalizer / MetricsAdvisor / AnomalyDetector adapters | Azure retiring 2026 |

---

## 9. Decisions still pending — resolve before P3

| # | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | Mediator: hand-rolled facade vs `Mediator` (martinothamar) source-gen | Spike both; perf + license matter |
| 9.3 | FluentAssertions v7 vs AwesomeAssertions vs Shouldly | License pressure on FA v8+; pick OSS path |
| 9.4 | Default cache: HybridCache vs FusionCache | FusionCache richer; HybridCache first-party |
| 9.5 | OutputCache adapter: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OutputCaching.StackExchangeRedis` vs custom HybridCache adapter | Redundancy if HybridCache covers it |
| 9.6 | OpenAPI: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` only vs Swashbuckle fallback | OpenAPI 3.1 gaps in MS impl? Verify |
| 9.7 | Multi-tenancy default: per-row vs per-DB | Settled: per-row only; per-DB and per-schema ruled out (migrations M55) |
| 9.8 | Identity API endpoints (.NET 8+ minimal) vs full ASP.NET Core Identity scaffolding | Likely both, with the minimal API endpoints as the bundled default |
| 9.9 | Real-time default: SignalR alone vs SignalR + SSE side-by-side | Both — SignalR for bidi, SSE for LLM streams |
| 9.10 | gRPC: ship as core or as companion | Bundle adds ~medium cost; might be companion |
| 9.11 | NodaTime: core dep vs companion | If included, all internal time types use it; spec-impact |
| 9.12 | License audit on every transitive dep | One-pass check before P1 ships; document |
| 9.13 | AOT compatibility matrix per subpath | Spike each; document support level |
| 9.14 | Source-gen vs Roslyn analyzer enforcement of foundation/domain rule | UI lib uses ESLint; we need a Roslyn analyzer |
| 9.15 | Whether to include Aspire integrations in core or only as companion | Aspire is the orchestration story; likely companion |

---

## 10. Sequencing summary (TL;DR)

**P0 (parallel track, ongoing)** — `testing` companion: `WebApiTestHost<T>` + Testcontainers fixtures + Verify + AwesomeAssertions + Bogus + WireMock.Net. Ships *with* P1 so every wrapper has runnable examples on day 1.

**P1 (boot floor)** — broadest-applicability defaults: Hosting / DI / Options + validators / Serilog→ILogger seam / OTel auto-instrumentation / ProblemDetails / `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` / Health checks / Rate limiting / Output cache / Secure headers / `TimeProvider` / Analyzer pack.

**P2 (request pipeline + auth)** — the seam everything else hangs on: in-proc mediator / FluentValidation pipeline / `IExceptionHandler` / Identity API endpoints + JWT + OIDC / Vogen + Guard clauses / ErrorOr + OneOf / Idempotency.

**P3 (persistence + outbound)** — EF Core + audit/soft-delete + Dapper + bulk + HybridCache + Redis + Refit + resilience.

**P4 (distributed essentials)** — DotNetCore.CAP outbox + Hangfire jobs + comms abstractions + webhook infra.

**P5 (SaaS-shaped)** — Finbuckle multi-tenancy + `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` + Semantic Kernel + vector store adapters + feature flags.

**P6 (heavy domain extensions)** — SignalR + storage + search + workflow + Aspire integrations + OpenIddict + GraphQL + OData + AOT cert + payments + geo + OCR + docs site.

Beta-forever rule applies throughout — fix-forward, no version gates, push to main, breaking changes go in normally.
