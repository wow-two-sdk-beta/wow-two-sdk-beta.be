# Messaging.Kafka

Second broker adapter behind the transport port (`Messaging/Transport/`) — and the one that exercises the
**emulated-DLQ** path (Kafka has no native dead-letter facility). Same `IEventHandler<T>` contract as in-memory /
RabbitMQ; only the wiring differs.

## Why it's the interesting one

`ITransportCapabilities.NativeDeadLetter = false` → the SDK **emulates** dead-lettering: `RabbitMqReceiveContext`
used the broker's DLX; `KafkaReceiveContext.DeadLetterAsync` instead **re-produces the message to a dead-letter topic**
then advances the offset. This proves the port's capability-flag design — the pipeline is identical; only the
`ReceiveContext.DeadLetterAsync` implementation changes per transport.

## Wire-up

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKafkaEventBus(o =>
{
    o.BootstrapServers = "localhost:9092";
    o.Topic           = "wt.events";
    o.GroupId         = "orders-service";   // consumer group
    o.DeadLetterTopic = "wt.events.dlq";    // emulated DLQ
}, typeof(Program).Assembly);
```

## Model

- **Publish**: `TransportEventBus` → `KafkaSendTransport` → `ProduceAsync` (JSON body, `wt-event-type` + `wt-message-id` + `traceparent` headers, key = `PartitionKey ?? MessageId`).
- **Consume**: `KafkaReceiveTransport` — `Subscribe(Topic)`, poll loop (`Consume(500ms)`), reconstruct envelope → `EventProcessingPipeline`. `EnableAutoCommit=true` + `EnableAutoOffsetStore=false` → we `StoreOffset` on settle (commit on ack).
- **Ack**: `ctx.Acknowledge` → `StoreOffset` (offset committed by the auto-committer).
- **DLQ (emulated)**: `ctx.DeadLetter` (retries exhausted) → re-produce the original message to `DeadLetterTopic`, then `StoreOffset` (advance past the poison message).

## Destination routing rollout

`KafkaOptions.RouteByDestination` is off by default — every message rides `KafkaOptions.Topic`. Turning it on changes
which topic a message lands on, so the switch is **consumers first**:

1. Deploy the consumers with `RouteByDestination = true`. A consumer with it on subscribes to `Topic` **as well as**
   every routed topic (one per consumed type, plus the endpoint's own name), so it keeps receiving from producers that
   have not been switched yet.
2. Once every consumer is across, turn it on for the producers. A publish then lands on the message type's own topic;
   an explicit `SendAsync` lands on the addressed endpoint's topic.
3. A routing key that sanitizes away to nothing (`KafkaTopicNameMapper`) falls back to `Topic`.

A producer switched ahead of its consumers produces to a topic nobody subscribes to.

## Capabilities

`KafkaCapabilities`: `NativeDeadLetter = false` (emulated) · `NativeOrdering = true` (per-partition) · `NativeDelay/NativeDedupe = false`.

## Types

| Type | Role |
|---|---|
| `KafkaOptions` | bootstrap · topic · group · DLQ topic |
| `KafkaSendTransport` | `ISendTransport` — produce to the topic |
| `KafkaReceiveTransport` | `IReceiveTransport` — subscribe + poll → pipeline |
| `KafkaReceiveContext` | `ReceiveContext` — ack = `StoreOffset`; dead-letter = re-produce to DLQ topic |
| `AddKafkaEventBus(…)` | DI registration |

## NEXT

- Per-partition concurrency (currently single poll loop); consumer-group rebalance handling; schema-registry option.
