# be sdk — Backlog

*Last updated: 2026-10-19*

Every unbuilt item, grouped; top of each group = next. Shipped capabilities live in
[`package-registry.md`](../architecture/package-registry.md) and git; deep-dives in [`research/`](../research/research.md).
The SDK versions as NuGet `10.y.z-beta`, so a feature reads `shipped` once the published family (`10.0.60-beta`) carries it.

## Vectors

SDK vectors without a group of their own below; each row is the vector's next completion pass.

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AI providers, SSE streaming and pgvector | feature | TranscriptForge pulls it forward; the coupled `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` 10.8.3 / OllamaSharp 5.5.0 adapter update is implemented |
| MCP capability completion | feature | Dedicated pass after Wheelhouse adopts the essential stateless HTTP host; inventory client adapters, resources, prompts, transports and lifecycle coverage before extending the slice |
| Payments, Stripe first | feature | ForeverPin billing and TranscriptForge wait on it — [D04](../research/foreverpin-adoption/foreverpin-adoption.md) |
| Tenancy strategies: Finbuckle, per-database, per-schema | feature | Per-row isolation ships |
| Feature-flag providers: LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat, Unleash, GrowthBook | feature | Flags, gates and the OpenFeature seam ship |
| FusionCache adapter | feature | Hybrid, memory and Redis caches ship with commit-aware invalidation |
| Code output: barcode and per-eye styling, logos, PDF and print | feature | ForeverPin deferral [D09](../research/foreverpin-adoption/foreverpin-adoption.md) |
| Geo: NetTopologySuite, geocoding, H3 and paid IP databases | feature | Free DB-IP Lite ships; paid databases wait on licensing — [E3](../research/foreverpin-extractions/foreverpin-extractions.md) |
| Realtime scale-out: SignalR Redis backplane and Azure SignalR | feature | SignalR, SSE and WebSockets ship |
| Search, PostgreSQL full-text first | feature | [targets](../architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md) §3.15 |
| Workflow, Stateless first | feature | [targets](../architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md) §3.10 |
| Google Cloud Storage adapter | feature | Local, S3 and Azure storage ship |

## Data

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Full-row reads and guarded writes in data sessions | feature | `FullRow<T>`, `LoadForUpdate`, write guards A/B, EF converter reflection — phase 3 of the [architecture](../research/data-pipeline/data-session-architecture.md); [test plan](../research/data-pipeline/data-session-test-plan.md) |
| Soft-delete, tenant and xmin fragments for hand-written Dapper SQL | feature | `SqlRead.Filters<T>()` and `Columns<T>()` over an EF-projected read profile; generated reads already filter |
| Manual flush and EF savepoint hooks in data sessions | feature | Nested rollback clears the tracker and needs a reload |
| Cache eviction from data-session commit hooks | feature | Verify HybridCache cross-node tag invalidation first — [research 02](../research/data-pipeline/research/02-transactional-cache-coherence.md) |
| NHibernate mapper for entity specs | feature | EF Core and Dapper mappers ship — [entity specs](../research/data-pipeline/entity-specs.md) |
| Partial updates and a second `DbContext` per session | feature | Deferred by the owner's fixed constraints |
| Mine Marten for the session and hook design | engineering | [Verdict](../research/data-pipeline/data-pipeline-verdict.md): Marten and Wolverine cover most of it, on a document store |
| Benchmark attach, savepoints and HybridCache reads | engineering | The attach win is unmeasured; no BenchmarkDotNet yet |

## Messaging

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AWS SQS and SNS transport | feature | Redrive DLQ, FIFO groups, visibility-timeout settlement — [maturity](../research/messaging/events-maturity-backlog.md) §3.1 |
| RabbitMQ unroutable-publish detection | feature | Opt-in `mandatory` returns, or an alternate exchange; weigh the exchange first |
| Persistent saga repositories: EF Core and Redis | feature | Only the in-memory repository ships — [maturity](../research/messaging/events-maturity-backlog.md) §3.7 |
| Pause Kafka partitions natively | fix | Parking the consume thread risks a `max.poll.interval.ms` eviction |
| Upgrade RabbitMQ.Client past 7.0.0 | fix | 7.0.0 skews publish sequence numbers on concurrent failure |
| Test and document saga destination bindings | engineering | Pin the anti-steal alias rule, document `SendsTo`, fix stale send-transport header comments |
| Run the Kafka dead-letter test on Linux CI | engineering | Skipped for a macOS librdkafka crash; the header-forgery check needs a raw consumer |
| Test the Service Bus adapter on its emulator | engineering | Its adapter-owned header round trip is unproven |
| Per-consumer inbox scoping | feature | Composite consumer and message key for shared inbox databases — [maturity](../research/messaging/events-maturity-backlog.md) §3.6 |
| Opt-in serializer seam for webhooks | feature | Webhooks stay off the seam today: presets would change every signed byte |

| Batch consumers and parallel fan-out | feature | [maturity](../research/messaging/events-maturity-backlog.md) §3.9 |
| Per-transport health checks and consumer-lag metrics | feature | [maturity](../research/messaging/events-maturity-backlog.md) §3.10–3.11 |

| AsyncAPI documents | feature | [architecture](../research/messaging/messaging-architecture-investigation.md) §6 |
| Elastic pipeline steps | feature | Idea only; a configured per-step mode first — [idea](../research/messaging/elastic-pipeline-steps.md) |

---

## Identity

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Organizations and invitations | feature | Needs the owner's model — [SaaS essentials](../research/sdk-completion/saas-essentials.md) |
| Verify six best-effort OAuth claim profiles | engineering | X, Yandex, VK, Amazon, Slack, Notion against each library's `ClaimActions` — [identity](../research/identity/identity-architecture.md) |
| Register the OAuth baseline vectors in `targets.md` | engineering | Claim normalizer, cookie mode, allowlist and default-deny |

---

## Errors

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Error-code analyzer | feature | [errors](../research/errors/errors-architecture-investigation.md) |
| `HelpLink` and remediation guidance on `AppError` | feature | `HelpLink` maps to the ProblemDetails `type` |
| Settle the ProblemDetails `type` URI scheme | engineering | URNs today |
| Rename `FieldError` to `ValidationFailure` | engineering | Breaking; consumers re-pin |

---

## Media

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Word template conditionals and paragraph loops | feature | `{{#if}}` and `{{#each}}` blocks — [documents](../research/media/documents.md) |
| PDF to images companion over PDFium | feature | Parked on native size, about 10 MB per platform — [images and PDF](../research/media/images-and-pdf.md) |
| PDF Bates numbering, redaction, flattening and OCR | feature | Inline in pdf-editor today; flattening exists nowhere |

---

## Quality

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Component registry: registration ledger and slot-drain checks | engineering | Record skipped `TryAdd` and `Replace` calls; fail on undrained slots — [verdict](../research/component-registry/component-registry-idea.md) |
| Roslyn analyzer: Foundation imports no domain package | engineering | Pending decision 9.14 in [targets](../architecture/analysis/philosophy/targets.md) |
| Aspire playground end-to-end smoke | engineering | Nothing runs the wrappers end to end |
| Cap decompressed request bodies | fix | Request limits bound only the compressed input |

---

## Product-reported gaps

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vault consumer module: startup resolution, bounded timeout, precedence, fail-closed | feature | SecretsVault; then release and ForeverPin re-pins. Wheelhouse tracks it too |
| `WebApiTestHost` resolves configuration read at registration lazily | fix | ListingShelf; overrides miss it today, so tests can reach the dev database |
| `WebApiTestHost` binds JWT bearer validation to its `FakeTimeProvider` | fix | SecretsVault token-lifetime tests |
| `RelationalTestDb` builds a schema owned by SQL migrations | feature | ListingShelf |
| SPA hosting: immutable cache on hashed assets, revalidation on the shell | fix | ListingShelf |
| Stored JSON presets keep dictionary keys verbatim | fix | ListingShelf; keys are camelCased today |
| CSV file result with spreadsheet-safe cells | feature | ListingShelf |
| Enum-mapping seam in `AddPostgresPersistence` | feature | TranscriptForge and Haven both map enums by hand |
| Carry a product's XML docs into its OpenAPI document | feature | TranscriptForge |
| Adopt the generic MCP host in TranscriptForge | engineering | SDK host and coupled AI 10.x / OllamaSharp update implemented; the separate consumer adoption remains |
| Transcript fetch in `Media.Transcripts` | feature | Sift is the second consumer after TranscriptForge; check against the shipped caption parser |
| HTML listing extraction shared by ListingShelf and Haven | feature | ListingShelf collects; Haven never crawls |
| Publish granular entity abstractions | engineering | SecretsVault; slims the Domain dependency closure |
| Drop vulnerable transitive packages | fix | Sift and PbnStudio on `10.0.21-beta`: Snappier 1.0.0, SSH.NET 2023.0.0, Datadog.Trace 3.7.0; check the current family first |
| Keep providers out of small apps' restore graph | engineering | Sift: the mono-lib pulls AWS, Hangfire and every OAuth provider; re-check after the companion split |
| MCP host checks `Origin` and caps the request body | fix | Wheelhouse: the spec requires the Origin 403; `MapAuthenticatedMcp` has neither, so `McpRequestGuard.cs` does both locally (64 KiB, 413) |
| SPA hosting reserves path prefixes beyond the API prefix | feature | Wheelhouse: `/.well-known/*` must 404, not serve the shell; it adds its own fallback in `HostConfiguration.cs` |
| GitHub client reads a repository's default branch | feature | Wheelhouse catalog import assumes `main` because `IGitHubClient` can't read it |
| YAML reader beside the JSON presets | feature | Wheelhouse reads `catalog.yml` and `deploy.yml` with YamlDotNet 16.3.0 locally; the one-manifest work makes YAML a shared need |
| Opaque cursor helper for paged reads | feature | Wheelhouse deployment history encodes its own cursor |

---

## Adoption

| Item | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Re-pin the direct consumers to the latest beta | engineering | TransportBrain, Tnis, TnisMintrans, Wheelhouse, SecretsVault, ListingShelf, Sift, Arcade, MuseumsGallery, TranscriptForge (plus its caption-parser namespace), product template; ForeverPin re-verifies on published `10.0.60-beta`; the ten first-batch ventures (ConfigChecker, CustomerPromises, DocumentationChecker, EpubReview, FileWatch, PodcastReadiness, ProcedureReview, RetainerBalance, TrainingSeats, VendorRenewals) pin a local `10.0.60-beta.local` build |
| Dogfood the identity slices in Haven.Auth | product | Identity build step 10 — [identity](../research/identity/identity-architecture.md) |
| Adopt `Media.Pdf` and `Media.Word` in pdf-editor | product | The extraction source proves parity first — [images and PDF](../research/media/images-and-pdf.md) |
