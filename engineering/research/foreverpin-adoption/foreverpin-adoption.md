# ForeverPin SDK adoption sweep

*Last updated: 2026-09-26*

> Full backend component inventory for one coordinated SDK improvement and ForeverPin upgrade cut.
> This owns the SDK-facing sweep; product UX and unresolved delivery choices remain in ForeverPin's product tracks.

## Status

- [x] Inventory both hosts, all 12 projects and all 215 authored C# files.
- [x] Trace SDK imports and product-owned infrastructure against current SDK source.
- [x] Reproduce four SDK boundary defects in an isolated executable.
- [x] Improve and test publication verification; published in `10.0.57-beta` from `a645d1b`.
- [x] Implement the autonomous SDK cut with focused regressions; product-only rows remain below.
- [x] Verify the complete candidate family and prepare the developer-owned release.
- [x] Publish the candidate: `ba2a87e` released as `10.0.58-beta`; all seven packages verified on NuGet.
- [x] Apply the authorized product adoption cut across both hosts and all 12 backend projects.
- [x] Complete final product regressions against the local SDK candidate: 231 passed, zero skipped.
- [x] Publish the adoption-discovered SDK corrections: `10.0.59-beta`, run `36233039580`; ForeverPin pins it centrally.
- [x] Run the published-package backend verifier: 231 passed, zero skipped; frontend acceptance stays separate.
- [x] Commit the ForeverPin adoption: `0ac30af`, with the .NET SDK pin `36dc3a0`.

The user authorized deep implementation where the answer follows from current contracts.
Work requiring new product or platform policy is deferred explicitly below.
The original `10.0.58-beta` cut is published. Adoption exposed two additional SDK corrections, published in `10.0.59-beta`.
ForeverPin pins that version and passes its backend verifier. Commit permission is enforced by each repository's native switch.
Product evidence: [backend adoption](../../../../../ventures/10x-venture-forever-pin/engineering/architecture/backend-adoption.md).

## Original baseline

- SDK source baseline: `b01f6b6`; CI released `10.0.56-beta` at `a7f98013abfc6b7fb4c1ea2bbc08b228297726ea`.
  The peeled remote tag matches the revision recorded by the workflow's pack and package-verification steps.
- [Publish run](https://github.com/wow-two-sdk-beta/wow-two-sdk.backend.beta/actions/runs/35426464818):
  build, tests, packing, NuGet push and release tag succeeded; the propagation check timed out.
- All seven package URLs returned HTTP 200 during this sweep, including the new verifier's live run.
- ForeverPin references runtime `10.0.45-beta` and testing `10.0.40-beta`.
- The shared ForeverPin checkout has another lane's solution/verification changes; preserve its index and worktree.
- The prior package probe's 29 compilation errors were the first failing layers, not an exhaustive migration list.
  Source review also finds current-user/guest names, style serialization, error factories and fixture API changes.
- The first published adoption cut was `10.0.58-beta`: candidate commit `ba2a87e`, release commit `546466e`,
  annotated tag `v10.0.58-beta` peeling to `546466e`. The final consumer release must also include the later
  optional-calendar-end and test-host corrections recorded below.

Product file names below resolve under ForeverPin's `engineering/codebase/forever-pin.backend-services/`.
SDK source paths resolve under `engineering/codebase/wow-two-sdk-beta-be/src/`.

## Ownership inventory

| Area | Existing product seam | SDK ownership and disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Host floor | Both `HostConfiguration` partials and `Program` files | Keep product composition; adopt `ApiDefaults`, startup diagnostics and identity callback. |
| Configuration | `ApiSettings`, `AuthSettings`, `BillingSettings`, `RedirectSettings` | Keep product settings; use `ConfigurationMapper` and validate enabled capabilities. |
| Observability | SDK defaults, handler loggers, scan-flush logger | SDK owns logging/traces/error recording; product owns business event labels and scan metrics. |
| Errors / HTTP | `ControllerProblemExtensions`, broad handler catches | SDK owns exception classification and ProblemDetails factory; product owns its error catalog. |
| Mediator / results | Commands, queries, `AppResult`, success wrappers | Keep product requests and results; consume the SDK pipeline without nested dispatch. |
| Validation | Content, rule, rule-set and command validators | Keep business rules; SDK owns adapters, aggregation and field-error mapping. |
| JSON union registration | Local `SubtypeRegistry` and JSON extension | Remove duplicate implementations; use SDK registry and modifier. |
| Stored JSON | `JsonbOptions`, `CodeContentJson`, `CodeRuleJson`, SDK `StyleSpecJson` calls | Remove per-type wrappers; use immutable SDK profiles and direct serialization. |
| EF JSON tracking | `CodeEntityConfiguration` converter/comparer | Use SDK `HasJsonConversion`; verify full graph snapshot and old data compatibility. |
| Entities / repositories | Four entities; code, user and subscription repositories | Keep domain types and owner-scoped queries; SDK owns traits/audit/common persistence mechanics. |
| Migrations | SQL resources, startup apply and migration harness | Keep product SQL; adopt SDK result-returning runner and updated fixtures. |
| Transactions / concurrency | Count/check/write, guest claiming, webhook upsert, scan flush | SDK owns generic transaction mechanics; product owns invariant scope and retry decisions. |
| Guest identity | Raw `user-id` cookie resolves the owner ID | SDK must authenticate the guest capability; product owns guest-to-account transfer. |
| Registered identity | Google sign-in, cookie issuance, claims | Adopt `IGoogleIdTokenAuthenticator` and renamed services; retain product account projection. |
| CSRF / browser auth | Cookie-authenticated mutations and Google sign-in | Reusable protection belongs in SDK; product wires endpoints and browser token handling. |
| Code rendering | `CodeImageService`, SDK QR/barcode engine | SDK owns render safety and image format guarantees; product maps mode/rules to payload. |
| Payload serialization | Wi-Fi, mail, SMS, phone, geo, vCard and calendar encoders | Generic protocol encoding belongs in SDK; product content union and routing modes remain local. |
| Short IDs | `SlugGenerator` | Generic cryptographic generation belongs in SDK; length and collision retries remain product choices. |
| Routing / request context | `RoutingService`, UA mapper, language parser, direct UTC reads | Keep rule policy; reusable UA/language/time primitives belong in SDK. |
| Geo | `NoopGeoBroker` | IP geolocation is a future SDK adapter; provider/database operations require a decision. |
| Caching | Unwired `CachedRedirectCodeRepository`; active DB repository | SDK already has cache seams; preserve fresh reads until invalidation semantics are settled. |
| Analytics / background work | Bounded channel and scan-flush worker | Keep scan models/projection; reusable queue/lifecycle mechanics may move into SDK. |
| Billing / outbound I/O | `StripeBillingBroker`, checkout/portal/webhook handlers | Stripe protocol mechanics belong in SDK; plans, entitlements and fulfillment remain product policy. |
| Testing | Unit, repository, multi-host and migration suites | SDK owns generic fixtures and engine tests; product owns stored-format and endpoint regressions. |
| Build / dependencies | Repeated SDK pins and floating package versions | Align one family version, stabilize build inputs and remove unused references after evaluation. |
| Localization | English validation/error messages; routing language parsing | SDK request culture and mapper seams exist; full translation remains a separate vector. |
| Unused vectors | Messaging, jobs, storage, AI, tenancy, realtime, generic outbound HTTP | No current direct product use was found; do not add registrations solely because an SDK API exists. |

No blanket repository replacement is justified: `GetByIdForUserAsync`, subscription identity and guest claiming carry
product policy that a generic CRUD API does not replace. `ContentMode`, `CodeRuleType`, plans and product response shapes
also stay in the product. A folder named `Common` alone is not evidence that its contents belong in the SDK.

## Autonomous implementation cut

The following work is authorized and does not need another naming or design vote. Checkboxes are execution state,
not a request for confirmation. Apply SDK corrections first and consume them through one published package cut.

### A01 — CI publication verification

- [x] Poll only unavailable packages under one 15-minute deadline, with bounded individual requests.
- [x] Print each unavailable ID, HTTP status and curl status; list all unverified IDs on timeout.
- [x] Verify the annotated remote tag resolves to the exact tested release revision.
- [x] Cover immediate success, delayed propagation, transport recovery, timeout, slow requests and bad arguments.
- [x] Run the actual verifier against all seven `10.0.56-beta` packages.
- Do not rerun the whole publisher merely to recheck NuGet visibility: that creates a new version.

### A02 — Complete API migration inventory

- [x] Consume `ICodeRenderer.Render` as `Result<RenderedCode>` and map its validation error at the HTTP boundary.
- [x] Replace manually constructed renderers with SDK registration or pass the new rasterizer collaborator.
- [x] Configure persistent/shared Data Protection keys for intended guest-sharing hosts; legacy raw guest cookies are rejected.

- [x] Centralize runtime and testing references under one version property.
- [x] Set that property to `10.0.59-beta`, the published version containing the adoption-discovered corrections.
- [x] Migrate `ConfigurationLoader` to `ConfigurationMapper`.
- [x] Migrate `IGoogleIdTokenVerifier` / registration / fake to the authenticator contract.
- [x] Migrate `ICurrentUser` and `IGuestSession` to `ICurrentUserService` and `IGuestSessionService`.
- [x] Migrate `StyleSpecNormalizer` to `StyleSpecMapper`.
- [x] Replace static ProblemDetails creation and `IErrorMessageResolver` with `IAppErrorProblemDetailsFactory`.
- [x] Replace migration exception assertions with `Result<T>` success/failure assertions.
- [x] Replace removed `MultiHostFixture.ConfigureEnvironment` with host-local configuration hooks.
- Acceptance: every backend project compiles, including the management host and test harnesses previously hidden
  behind upstream compiler failures. Update the host-local connection, redirect URL and fake-service registrations.

### A03 — Error classification and safe responses

- [x] Teach SDK database mapping to classify EF-wrapped provider failures while preserving the outer diagnostic cause.
- [x] Remove product broad catches that convert unexpected exceptions and cancellation into `Unexpected(ex.Message)`.
- [x] Keep deliberately handled business failures typed and safe; scope webhook signature handling narrowly.
- [x] Render product failures through the registered SDK ProblemDetails factory, preserving field paths and headers.
- [x] Move the generic controller-to-ProblemDetails adapter into the SDK; no product-specific logic belongs in it.
- Reproduced: direct PostgreSQL `23505` maps to `Conflict`; the same error inside `DbUpdateException` is unmapped.
  Removing product catches alone will therefore not establish correct 409 behavior.
- Acceptance: real PostgreSQL unique violation through HTTP gives 409; unexpected failures expose no database/provider
  text; request cancellation is not reclassified as a business failure; each unexpected failure is recorded once.

### A04 — JSON consolidation and persisted-contract compatibility

- [x] Harden SDK subtype registration: decoded JSON tokens, unique discriminators, declared kinds, closed/non-null types and read-only entries.
- [x] Verify stored JSON snapshots isolate nested mutation and retain equality across serialization.

- [x] Remove the local generic registry, modifier and `JsonbOptions` duplicates.
- [x] Register product union profiles explicitly in both hosts and provider-specific test contexts.
- [x] Replace `CodeContentJson`, `CodeRuleJson` and removed `StyleSpecJson` calls with direct SDK-backed serialization.
- [x] Replace the custom shallow EF comparer/converter with `HasJsonConversion` under the stored rule profile.
- [x] Add corpus tests for every content/rule subtype, reordered jsonb discriminators and legacy style documents.
- Preserve the accepting boundary's established absence behavior: content null/blank → absent; rules null/blank → empty.
- Style tests currently promise null/blank/`{}`/malformed → default. Raw `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StyleSpec>` does not
  preserve that behavior; keep the default/recovery policy at the stored-style read boundary, without a wrapper role.
- Do not silently change stored ECC tokens: current product tests expect `"H"`; the generic stored preset uses
  camelCase enum strings. Test reading old values and define the explicit stored profile before changing writes.
- EF model metadata is cached: do not capture a scoped provider or mutable per-request serializer into the model.

### A05 — Rendering guarantees and input safety

- [x] Make the SDK facade return PNG for every supported barcode when PNG is requested.
- [x] Reject unsupported format/symbology values rather than silently selecting SVG or Code128.
- [x] Escape every caller-provided SVG attribute, including colors and gradient-stop colors.
- [x] Add external style/request validation for finite numeric values, bounded dimensions and supported data images.
- [x] Bound raster allocation and handle invalid SVG/native allocation failure as controlled failures.
- [x] Carry generic renderer/normalizer/shape/decode tests into the SDK; keep product payload and HTTP tests local.
- Original baseline reproduced: Code128 + PNG returns `Format=Svg` and `image/svg+xml`.
- Original baseline reproduced: a quote in `ForegroundColor` injects a separate attribute into the emitted SVG.
  This proves an output-encoding defect; browser script execution and external resource fetching were not tested.
- Acceptance: PNG signatures and MIME types agree; SVG remains valid XML under hostile strings; non-finite or enormous
  inputs are rejected before native rendering; valid preview/saved-image parity and decode coverage remain intact.

### A06 — Validation at product entry points

- [x] Validate preview input before rendering; it currently bypasses mediator validation.
- [x] Reject null collections/content/style and undefined enum values at the HTTP boundary.
- [x] Load the owner-scoped entity before mode-dependent update validation; use its persisted mode.
- [x] Reuse product validators through SDK adapters while preserving `Rules[i].Content.*` failure paths.
- [x] Validate condition values as device/country/language/time-window data rather than only nonempty strings.
- Keep input validation external. The loaded-data phase must not introduce nested request dispatch.
- Acceptance: malformed preview returns 400; a static update cannot acquire multiple rules; unauthorized/absent targets
  retain the product's owner-scoped response contract; failed validation leaves the row unchanged.

### A07 — Guest capability correctness

- [x] Replace SDK raw-GUID cookie trust with an authenticated guest capability, shared by provisioning and resolution.
- [x] Reject tampered/raw values and isolate the guest capability's purpose from registered account authentication.
- [x] Clear the request's resolved guest state consistently when the guest session is cleared.
- [x] Require a valid guest capability for product guest-to-account reassignment.
- Reproduced: setting an arbitrary GUID in `user-id` makes `CookieCurrentUserService` return that owner as a guest.
  Product repositories scope directly by this ID; sign-in may reassign all rows owned by that supplied ID.
- Acceptance: forged account/guest IDs cannot read, mutate or claim rows; valid same-device guest claiming still works.
- A legacy raw-cookie fallback would preserve the defect. If preservation of real existing guest sessions becomes
  necessary, pause only that rollout policy; the secure codec and regression tests can be implemented independently.

### A08 — Host composition, settings and clocks

- [x] Apply settled subject names: `AddPostgresDatabase`, `AddCodes`, `AddMediator`, `AddRouting`.
- [x] Put identity middleware in the SDK's `UseApiDefaults` callback.
- [x] Use startup diagnostics for both hosts and validate settings for explicitly enabled external capabilities.
- [x] Replace inert `Logging:LogLevel` with the Serilog configuration actually consumed.
- [x] Inject `TimeProvider` into redirect request context and tests instead of reading `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` directly.
- Acceptance: both hosts boot; identity precedes identity-sensitive policies; one fake clock controls routing/audit tests.

### A09 — Bounded correctness work in data and background processing

- [x] Keep tracked entity mutation; reject accidental detached replacement writes rather than silently doing nothing.
- [x] Make one scan flush atomically insert events and update their counters using the existing EF transaction API.
- [x] Add shutdown/drain and drop/failure observability to the existing bounded scan queue.
- [x] Add SDK unbiased cryptographic ID generation with caller-owned length/alphabet.
- [x] Adopt the generator in the product; bound collision retries and rely on the database unique constraint.
- The original product generator reduced bytes modulo 62; the adopted SDK generator uses unbiased selection.
- Do not invent a universal data-session abstraction to fix one EF-only transaction.
- Acceptance: failed scan flush cannot leave events/counters inconsistent; cancellation does not masquerade as success;
  a forced slug collision cannot spin indefinitely or overwrite an existing code.
- Plan caps, concurrent subscription upserts and guest-transfer transaction scope need explicit concurrency tests.
  Shared infrastructure may support them; entitlement and conflict-resolution policy remain product-owned.

### A10 — Reusable payload and request-context primitives

- [x] Extract protocol encoding from product-specific content records into typed SDK serializers, retaining the union locally.
- [x] Preserve the current valid payload corpus before changing protocol details; add boundary/escaping/culture tests.
- [x] Fix the known HTTP destination path to read the URL from URL/mobile-app content rather than calling `Encode()`.
- [x] Extract reusable User-Agent classification and preference-aware language parsing; retain product rule evaluation.
- Original source evidence: URL and mobile-app `Encode()` returned null while `RoutingService.Resolve` called it.
  Dynamic routing fell through to `NotFound`; adoption now reads the destination URL and has product regressions.
- SDK `FloatingCalendarEventExporter` explicitly accepts timezone-free `LocalDateTime`; it does not infer timezone policy.
- Protocol corrections are tested and recorded in `Codes/Payloads/Payloads.spec.md`; the product corpus changes during adoption.
- Calendar timezone semantics and non-HTTP delivery remain deferred, not guessed during generic extraction.
- Acceptance: URL/mobile-app destinations resolve; valid existing payloads retain agreed semantics; accepted language
  weights/exclusions and invariant time-window parsing have explicit tests.

### A11 — Testing and build reproducibility

- [x] Centralize family versions; evaluate direct package usage before removing duplicate/transitive references.
- [x] Pin currently floating build dependencies and the .NET SDK to a verified compatible baseline.
- [x] Add shared build settings consistent with the service convention; run all resulting diagnostics.
- [x] Replace global environment mutations and the obsolete test-provider comment with instance-owned fixture settings.
- [x] Ensure test overrides preserve audit/other production interceptors.
- [x] Keep generic migration engine tests in SDK; retain product migration resources and host startup coverage locally.
- Nullable is already enabled in the current projects. The old handoff claim that no `Directory.Build.props` means
  nullable warnings cannot surface is refuted; the gap is centralized reproducible policy, not absent nullable analysis.
- Do not rename or restage another lane's solution/verification files during this cut.

### A12 — API/application convention adoption

- [x] Apply domain-first API placement and settled `*Dto` edge / `*Model` application naming.
- [x] Keep trivial request mapping in its request file; retain actual product orchestration services.
- [x] Move roles such as background workers and extensions to their agreed folders.
- [x] Reconcile the old naming/documentation rows against current source rather than replaying the historical counts.
- These are product changes in the coordinated upgrade, not reasons to grow new SDK wrappers.

## Deferred decisions

These items require a new contract, operational choice or product policy. They do not block independent corrections
above, and they are not deferred merely because their implementation is long.

| ID | Decision / existing owner | Safe boundary for this cut |
|---|---|---|
| D01 | SDK `IDataSession` ships opt-in since `10.0.59-beta`; product adoption is not required for this cut | Product invariants use its existing shared EF context and transactions; no second session abstraction is needed for this adoption. |
| D02 | Cache invalidation across management and redirect hosts; freshness and deployment topology | Keep the active uncached DB path; SDK cache availability alone does not justify wiring stale reads. |
| D03 | Dynamic non-HTTP delivery, resolve-page host, geo behavior and calendar timezone meaning; product delivery policy | Fix already-defined URL routing; preserve/defer the remaining delivery choices. |
| D04 | Full payments adapter and webhook state/replay/order model; Stripe target is currently LATER | Keep product plans local; map provider failures safely; no speculative generic billing framework. |
| D05 | IP geolocation provider, database licensing/update process and proxy trust boundary | Do not claim country routing works while `NoopGeoBroker` is registered. |
| D06 | Complete translation catalogs, culture/fallback policy and error-code governance | Adopt existing field-error/message seams; retain current English contract. |
| D07 | Full identity rebuild, guest account separation/recovery and browser CSRF contract | Close raw guest-cookie trust independently; coordinate any browser protocol change with the frontend lane. |
| D08 | Durable analytics, retention/privacy requirements and queue loss guarantees | Make the current best-effort flush atomic/observable; do not silently promise durable delivery. |
| D09 | Barcode styling scope, PDF/print output, per-eye styling and richer logo options | Honor existing SVG/PNG requests and validate inputs; new visual/output policy stays in its vector. |

Further findings can extend these subjects; do not create a new discussion for an already-settled name or mechanical fix.

## Verification and commit handoff

### Product adoption candidate — 2026-09-26

- SDK source base: `94b32a9fb71a703c52d82f5ab67e74b238159cfe`; HTTP/data/idempotency follow-up commits are local.
- Adoption corrections committed: `f84aeba` makes `FloatingCalendarEventModel.End` optional;
  `c40fd57` makes `WebApiTestHost` default to `Development` so dependency lifetime validation remains enabled.
  Neither correction is in published `10.0.58-beta`.
- Full SDK Release run before the test-host correction: 610 passed, one existing Kafka skip.
  The affected Web suite was rerun after that correction: 103 passed, zero skipped.
- All seven `10.0.59-beta.local.20260926.2` package/symbol pairs passed artifact verification under
  `/tmp/foreverpin-sdk-candidate-20260926-2`. Their repository metadata identifies the base revision;
  these working-tree artifacts do not claim a committed or published snapshot.
- ForeverPin's complete final candidate run passed: 81 HTTP, 30 PostgreSQL integration, one product migration
  and 119 unit tests; 231 passed, zero skipped. Evidence: `/tmp/foreverpin-adoption-tests-final.log`.
  The run includes deep JSON tracking, owner-transfer races, field-path validation and both host environments.
- Both runtime and test package references use `BackendSdkVersion`, now `10.0.59-beta` from nuget.org.
- Published-package verification, 2026-09-26: all 12 projects restore `10.0.59-beta`; the backend verifier passed
  81 HTTP, 30 PostgreSQL integration, one migration and 119 unit tests with no local override.
- Frontend/browser acceptance and provider-backed production verification remain separate.

### CI batch — published

- `python3 scripts/test-verify-published-packages.py`: six tests passed.
- `bash -n scripts/verify-published-packages.sh`: passed.
- Workflow YAML parsed successfully with Ruby's YAML parser.
- Every workflow shell step passed `bash -n`; the live peeled tag matches the package-verification revision.
- `bash scripts/verify-published-packages.sh 10.0.56-beta 60 5`: all seven packages confirmed available.
- `git diff --check`: passed for the CI change.
- CI correction committed as `a645d1b`; release commit `66aceb2` carries `10.0.57-beta`.
- [Publish run 35428036926](https://github.com/wow-two-sdk-beta/wow-two-sdk.backend.beta/actions/runs/35428036926)
  completed successfully, including the new bounded propagation check.

### SDK candidate — 2026-09-19

- Full Release solution built successfully; no new package dependencies or project files were required.
- All seven package/symbol pairs passed `verify-release-packages.sh`, including assembly assets, dependency family,
  version and repository metadata. Local artifacts: `/tmp/sdk-adoption-pack-3trb__zs`.
- These are uncommitted working-tree packages using the existing `10.0.57-beta` build version and baseline metadata,
  not a published `10.0.58-beta` or a claim that `66aceb2` contains these edits. CI rebuilds the developer's committed revision.
- The three test-companion packs completed with `-m:1`; default worker fan-out stalled locally. CI pack commands and
  SDK build guidance now use the same single-worker setting. Actual artifact verification passed after the retry.
- All seven suites executed: **552 passed, one existing Kafka dead-letter skip**.

| Suite | Passed | Skipped |
|---|---:|---:|
| Data | 28 | 0 |
| Foundation | 204 | 0 |
| Identity | 25 | 0 |
| Mediator | 69 | 0 |
| Messaging | 124 | 1 |
| Migrations | 26 | 0 |
| Web | 76 | 0 |

- Rendering regressions decode PNG output for all seven symbologies. The transferred QR corpus covers exact default SVG
  parity, module/finder geometry, gradients, transparent backgrounds and center emoji.
- Security regressions reject raw/tampered/expired/wrong-purpose/wrong-key guest cookies and unsafe SVG/image inputs.
  Provision/clear/reprovision agree with current-user resolution inside the same request.
- Serialization regressions cover nested JSON snapshots, escaped/duplicate subtype tokens, protocol corpus, Unicode folding,
  invariant coordinates and weighted language preferences. A custom HTTP factory proves controller response replacement.
- Full suite required native execution after sandbox `SocketException (13)`; the authorized retry completed successfully.
- Mechanical convention sweep reports no folded/banned role, bare IEntity, para-tag or severity-glyph hits.
  Static-form hits are the existing permitted factories; new behavior implementations use instance roles.
- Breaking adoption requirements are recorded under A02.
- Committed as `ba2a87e` (`feat: completed breaking SDK fixes for ForeverPin adoption`).
- [Publish run 35442850653](https://github.com/wow-two-sdk-beta/wow-two-sdk.backend.beta/actions/runs/35442850653)
  reran the same seven suites on that commit: 552 passed, one Kafka skip. It released `10.0.58-beta`.
- Deferred D01–D09 remain decisions, not partially implemented platform guarantees.

### Original baseline reproductions — corrected in this candidate

An isolated console probe compiled the pre-fix source of `DbExceptionMappingRule`, `CodeRenderer`, `SvgRenderer` and
`CookieCurrentUserService` against existing SDK build dependencies. It did not change product files or contact providers.

```text
Direct unique violation: Conflict
EF-wrapped unique violation: unmapped
Requested barcode PNG: Svg, image/svg+xml
Color injected a new SVG attribute: True
Unsigned caller-selected ID accepted as guest: True
```

These baseline observations received passing SDK regressions in the original cut. The later product adoption
and its verification are recorded in the 2026-09-26 candidate section above.

### Coordinated upgrade gates

1. Completed: autonomous SDK corrections and regression tests; CI correction already published.
2. Completed: full SDK Release solution tested; seven package/symbol pairs verified from one revision.
3. Completed: `10.0.58-beta` published; seven packages available and the tag peels to `546466e`.
4. Implemented locally: ForeverPin host, payload, validation, identity, data and convention adoption.
5. Completed: `10.0.59-beta` published and pinned; the backend verifier passes on published packages.
6. Complete frontend integration and browser/manual acceptance in the product's separate frontend lane.

### Coverage ledger

| Project | Authored C# files | Audit boundary |
|---|---:|---|
| `ForeverPin.Api` | 22 | Host, controllers, requests, response/error mapping |
| `ForeverPin.Application` | 65 | CQRS contracts, validators, service ports, settings |
| `ForeverPin.Common.Domain` | 6 | Generic serialization duplicates and shared enum ownership |
| `ForeverPin.Common.Persistence` | 0 | Package references and an unused embedded-resource glob; actual SQL is in Persistence |
| `ForeverPin.Domain` | 35 | Entities, content/rule union, payload encoding and enums |
| `ForeverPin.Infrastructure` | 20 | Handlers, repositories, rendering, identity and Stripe |
| `ForeverPin.Persistence` | 6 | Context, configurations, JSON tracking and database types |
| `ForeverPin.Redirect.Api` | 20 | Host, routing, request metadata, queue and flush worker |
| `ForeverPin.Tests.Unit` | 15 | SDK engine vs product logic ownership and known contracts |
| `ForeverPin.Tests.Integration` | 6 | Repositories, provider choice and audit wiring |
| `ForeverPin.Tests.Migrations` | 8 | Runner results and migration guarantees |
| `ForeverPin.Tests.E2E` | 12 | Multi-host configuration, guest/auth/billing and redirect flows |

Build outputs and generated `obj` files are excluded. Frontend implementation, deployment operations and unrelated
SDK vectors are outside this backend adoption sweep. Existing documentation-only completion is not reset by this inventory.
